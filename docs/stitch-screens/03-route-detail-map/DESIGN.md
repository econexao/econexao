## Brand & Style

The design system is engineered for a multi-regional digital tourism platform that balances environmental stewardship with professional reliability. The brand personality is **authoritative yet organic**, targeting conscious travelers and institutional partners.

The design style utilizes **High-Contrast Minimalism** mixed with **Corporate Modern** elements. It relies on a heavy white-space strategy to maintain legibility across diverse regional content. Visual interest is generated through high-impact photography framed by structured, geometric containers. The aesthetic is clean and "breathable," avoiding clutter to ensure the user feels a sense of calm and clarity during the travel planning process.

## Colors

The palette is rooted in a "Forest-to-Sun" spectrum. 
- **Forest Green (#33601E)** serves as the primary driver for interaction, used for primary buttons and active states.
- **Deep Green (#1C3B0F)** provides the grounding for typography, ensuring AAA accessibility against the neutral background. 
- **Sun Yellow (#F8C900)** is used sparingly as a "high-velocity" accent for alerts, ratings, and critical highlights.
- **Neutral Backgrounds** should favor `#F7F8F5` for large surface areas to reduce eye strain, while `#FFFFFF` is reserved for elevated cards and input fields.

## Typography

This design system uses **Hanken Grotesk** across all levels to maintain a sharp, contemporary, and highly legible appearance. The typeface's geometric clarity supports the "professional" pillar of the brand.

**Hierarchy Rules:**
- **Headlines:** Use Deep Green (#1C3B0F). Display sizes should utilize tight letter-spacing for a "bold" editorial look.
- **Body Text:** Use a generous `1.6` line height to ensure readability for long-form regional guides.
- **Labels:** Uppercase styling is recommended for `label-md` when used in buttons or category chips to increase distinction.

## Layout & Spacing

The design system employs a **12-column Fluid Grid** for desktop and a **4-column grid** for mobile. 

**Spacing Rhythm:**
- A base unit of **4px** drives all spatial decisions.
- **Section Spacing:** Large vertical gaps (stack-lg) are encouraged between content blocks to maintain the "clean and professional" aesthetic.
- **Alignment:** All text-heavy containers should be left-aligned to reinforce the systematic, structured nature of the platform. 
- **Margins:** Desktop views use expansive 64px margins to create a "contained" feel for wide-screen users.

## Elevation & Depth

Hierarchy is established through **Tonal Layering** supplemented by **Ambient Shadows**.

1.  **Base Layer:** `#F7F8F5` (The canvas).
2.  **Raised Layer (Cards):** `#FFFFFF` with a very soft, diffused shadow (`0px 4px 20px rgba(28, 59, 15, 0.06)`). The shadow uses a Deep Green tint rather than pure black to maintain color harmony.
3.  **Interaction Layer:** Hover states on cards should slightly increase shadow spread and lift the element by 2px.
4.  **Flat Elements:** Borders (`1px solid #759B71`) are used for secondary inputs and ghost buttons instead of shadows to keep the UI from feeling overly "heavy."

## Shapes

The shape language is **Rounded (0.5rem base)**. This strike a balance between the organic nature of "Eco" and the precision of "Professional."

- **Cards & Primary Buttons:** 0.5rem (8px).
- **Input Fields:** 0.5rem (8px).
- **Chips/Status Indicators:** Full pill-shape (rounded-xl) to distinguish them from actionable buttons.
- **Imagery:** Large hero images should maintain sharp corners or very subtle 4px radii to retain a high-end, editorial feel.

## Components

### Route detail composition (Stitch refresh — 2026-09-15)
- The route hero uses the editorial cover, rounded 24px framing, a dark text scrim and an origin selector overlaid near the lower edge.
- A horizontal gallery follows the hero. Its item count is data-driven from `RouteDetail.gallery`; Pindobal has four bundled editorial fallbacks while its staging media is being curated.
- The existing map implementation, geometry, pins, bounds, interactions and adapter are intentionally unchanged. The redesign only repositions the map in the page flow.
- The local catalog remains contextual to the selected origin and keeps its loading, empty, error and retry behavior. Its route-detail preview shows up to six compact 72px cards, with a 50px category/image tile, one-line name, category badge and one-line address. The section heading does not display the route's total actor count.
- The trip CTA is a full-width green card with a primary label and status hint. Its main area starts a trip; the independent circular arrow opens the profile trip history.
- Alerts remain below the trip CTA and retain severity semantics.

### Buttons
- **Primary:** Solid Forest Green (#33601E) with White text. High contrast, bold weight.
- **Secondary (Ghost):** 1.5px border of Forest Green with Forest Green text. Clear, high-visibility affordance.
- **Tertiary:** No border, Deep Green text with an underline on hover.

### Cards
- Dynamic containers for destinations. Use a white background, soft ambient shadow, and a 1px Sage Green border at 20% opacity. 
- Titles within cards should always be Deep Green.

### Input Fields
- Use a white background and a 1px Sage Green border. 
- Focus state: Border changes to Forest Green with a 2px outer "glow" of 10% opacity Forest Green.

### Status Indicators (Success/Warning)
- **Positive indicators:** Use Leaf Green (#5D8D3E).
- **Alerts/Prices:** Use Sun Yellow (#F8C900) for text or background accents to draw immediate attention.

### Lists & Navigation
- Navigation items should use `label-md` typography.
- Active states in lists are marked by a vertical 4px bar of Forest Green on the left edge.
